ParleyDroid
-------------

ParleyDroid is a basic vocabulary trainer for Android devices. It is 
meant as a replacement for paper based flash cards. ParleyDroid reads 
KVTML2 files produced by Parley and other KDE-Edu applications and 
enables you to learn the contained vocabulary data while not in front 
of your computer.

ParleyDroid is a Android Port of the J2ME mobile application MobVoc.
See http://sourceforge.net/projects/mobvoc/ for more information.
Thanks to the MobVoc developer, Michael, for the great work he did
creating the KVTML2 Java data structures and parsing class!

KVTML2 vocabulary files can be created and edited with Parley and other
applications from the "KDE Education Project". Look at 
http://edu.kde.org/parley/ for further information about Parley or to
download vocabulary files. Go to http://edu.kde.org/ for general
information about KDE-Edu.
